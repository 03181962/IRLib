MAX_LAST_MARK_OR_SPACE - the length of time we wait for a pin change before deciding that the transmission is complete
TIMER - a hardware timer


when you detect a pin state change
  have TIMER trigger interrupt after MAX_LAST_MARK_OR_SPACE (will need to be started or reset)
  do existing processing (record mark or space)

when the TIMER interrupt occurs
  stop receiving
  stop TIMER
  flag that you have results
